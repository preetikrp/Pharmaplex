My Project is to find, compare and get information about search drugs. I am using GoodRx set of APIs for this project. 
It provides sticker price (means price uninsured customer will pay if they have no other discount available)
Here are the APIs I am using: 
The Fair Price API
The Low-Price API
The Price Comparison API
The Drug Search APi
The Drug Info API

The Fair Price API 
This price represents the maximum price that a consumer, with or without insurance, should pay for this drug at a local pharmacy.

The Low-Price API 
The Low-Price API provides the lowest cash price for a given prescription drug from a basket of nationwide pharmacy chains, including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, RiteAid, and others. (These chains represent more than 80% of retail drug purchases in America.)

The Price Comparison API 
The Price Comparison API provides the 3 lowest cash prices for a given prescription drug from a basket of nationwide pharmacy chains, including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, RiteAid, and others. (These chains represent more than 80% of retail drug purchases in America.)
The Drug Info API 
This service provides form and dosage options for drugs on GoodRx. For when you need to specify the dosage or form of the drug you want to display low prices for, you can use the Drug Info API to retrieve the available options on GoodRx. Since dosages and forms can be represented in so many ways, this API will take the ambiguity out of guessing what's available and allow you to show all options for easier construction of the price calls available on the GoodRx API.
